# CPP-JNI
Sample project that demonstrates using JNI to interface with Java applications via C++.

This project was created for a college course at Southern New Hampshire University: CS-210


# The following are prompts required by the professor of the course:

## What did you do particularly well?
- I believe I utilized and understood the concept of JNI, how it works, and how/when to use it very well. Understanding how data flows between languages has better equipped me to utilize JNI more in the future.

## Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
- The biggest area I could add improvements to the codebase is error handling and input validation. While there is some basic input validation in the code currently, more advanced input validation could be used to enforce stricter input standards, and could also allow for the output table to be more visually appealing.

## Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
- I found working with files to be quite challenging at first, but using the notes taken from zyBooks lessons, as well as using YouTube to see other implementations of file I/O, I was able to get file I/O working.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
- Almost everything from this project will be useful in the future. Being able to program I/O for files will be a skill used in many future projects. JNI will be useful in certain use cases where Java might be able to do a process more efficiently than C++. Simply working with lots of header files will lend to my success in the future, as I gained valuable experience in this project.

## How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- I spent a lot of time after "finishing" the code adding white spaces to block up sections of code, adding comments explaining methods, and adding inline comments as well
